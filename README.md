# GalileoSensorApplication
This application reads data from the Galileo6.DLL file and inserts it into a list view and list boxes called Sensor A and Sensor B.
You can change the Sigma and Mu of this data by using the combo boxes at the top left of the screen.
You can individually sort Sensor A and Sensor B data as well as searching for values.
There is complete error detection so the program won't crash when being used.
